# **Forest Football Quiz** 


## **Introduction**
Welcome to my second project, a general knowledge quiz app on Nottingham Forest Football club. 

The idea of my second project came from my love and interest in football in particular, my love for Nottingham Forest Football club and their promotion to the Premier league this year 2022. 

During the creation of my second project I have been able to develop my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. These skills have enabled me to create a more interactive and fun experience for the users. 

I aim to continuously develop and improve my skills I have learnt throughout my second project. 

In this README I will explain step by step the processes taken to create and plan this project including screen shots, images, links and more. 

Thank you for taking interest and viewing my project.

I hope you enjoy the quiz!

## **User Experience (UX)**


### **Creator Stories**

- ### Creator Goals
    - As a creator, I want the project to be accessible, fun and easy to play. 

    - As a creator, I want to create a football quiz as a celebration to their promotion to the Premier League. 

    - As a creator, I want to create a visually impressive quiz maintaining a football theme throughout. 

    Once creator goals have been set on what I want to accomplish with the quiz I set out to obtain relevant information through researching the football club history and achievements. 



### **User Stories**

- ### First time visitors goals
    - When visiting the quiz as a first time visitor, I want to see relevant pictures and themes that relate to the quiz topic, Nottingham Forest and football. So I have implemented a photo of the current football team as the background and football icons. I also want to have a clear understanding of how to play the quiz. I have implemented an about the quiz button, which gives instruction on how to play the quiz.
    
    - As a first time visitor, I want to easily navigate around the quiz without any difficulty. 

    - As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily find information about the quiz through social media links. I have placed these links at the bottom left of the page so they are easily found.

- ### Returning visitors goals
    - As a returning visitor, I want to find out about updates relating to the quiz. This can be found through the social media links, which are also used a point of contact.

- ### Frequent user goals
    - As a returning visitor, I would like to see visual changes and updates to the quiz content. For example the background image to be updated to the current Nottingham Forest football team.


### **Design**

- ### Colour Scheme 
    - The two main colours used were red and white as those are the colours of Nottingham Forest football kit and emblem.

- ### Typography 
    - I originally tried to use the offical Nottingham Forest emblem font however, this did not work because I could not find the font on Google fonts. Therefore, I chose the most simular looking font.

- ### Imagery 
    - I implemented a background image of the current Nottingham Forest football team to the body of the quiz.

- ### Wireframes

## **Testing**

The W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator services and JS Hint were used to validate every page of the project to ensure that were no errors, warnings or potential problems within the project.

I used the W3C Markup validator and W3C CSS validator as shown above and all errors and warnings were rectified.

I used JS Hint as shown above to check my Javascript code and all errors and problems were rectified.]

### **Testing User Stories**




**Furthing Testing**

I used Chrome developer tools to test the responsiveness of the quiz as well as testing it on different web browsers like Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari and Opera.
The quiz was viewed a several different devices such as:

- Desktop
- Laptop
- Iphone SE
- Iphone XR
- Iphone 12 Pro
- Pixel 5
- Samsung Galaxy 8+
- Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
- Ipad Air
- Ipad Mini 
- Surface Pro 7
- Surface Duo 
- Galaxy Fold
- Samsung Galaxy A51/71
- Nest Hub
- Nest Hub Max
- Iphone 6/7/8
- Iphone 6/7/8 Plus
- Iphone X
- Ipad
- Ipad Pro

**Lighthouse report**

I used the Google Lighthouse to check my project's performance, accessibility and user experience. The initial check results came back at 91 for overall performance which is shown in the screenshot below.
- [Lighthouse initial results](https://github.com/Joha-will/Portfolio-Project-2---Javascript-Essentials/blob/ccfb78205ae830d9e10caa1e59db4d5e989dd332/assets/images/lighthouseresults.png)

I then improved the performance by removing the link to the background image I had in the style.css file and used my own photo which was looked in the images folder. This increased the performance alot. I also added meta tags with a name and content attribute to the head element of the index.html file which took the Search Engine Optimization to 100. After making those changes, this then took the overall performance to 97 for desktop and 94 for mobile which can be viewed in the screenshots below.

- [Lighthouse Mobile results]()



### **Bugs and Errors found**

**HTML Errors and Warnings**

- [HTML error and warning screenShot](https://github.com/Joha-will/Portfolio-Project-2---Javascript-Essentials/blob/c3f62c760e3fa0cf2647017f8528ffb72b02b1f1/assets/images/htmlerrors.png)

The errors and warnings I encountered when validating my HTML page was rectified. The first warning I had was rectified by changing the section element to a div element as adviced by the W3C MarkUp Validator. I encountered this warning as my section element did not have a heading.

I also encountered two errors which came from the unordered list element in my footer element. I rectified this by completely removing the unordered list element and adding a div element with three paragraph elements. I then placed the anchor tags inside the paragraph elements. I encountered these errors because text was not allowed in unordered list element in the context I had it, as stated by the W3C MarkUp validator.

### **JS Hint Errors and Problems**

- [Quiz JS errors and problems screenshot](https://github.com/Joha-will/Portfolio-Project-2---Javascript-Essentials/blob/c3f62c760e3fa0cf2647017f8528ffb72b02b1f1/assets/images/jshinterrorstwo.png)

As shown in the screenshot above, most of the warnings that came for the quiz JS file was caused by missing semicolons and there was a unecessary semicolon, which was easily rectified by removing and adding semicolons. There were others like the warning on ling 109 where there was no zero infront of the decimal point and this was rectified by adding a zero. On line 151-152, there was an undefined variable as shown in the screenshot, which I rectified by declaring the variable globally. I also had an unused variable and a unused function. I removed the unused varible as it was not needed and the function I called at the end of the quiz JS file.

- [Script JS errors and problems screenshot](https://github.com/Joha-will/Portfolio-Project-2---Javascript-Essentials/blob/c3f62c760e3fa0cf2647017f8528ffb72b02b1f1/assets/images/jshinterrors.png)

As shown in the screenshot above, most of the warnings that came for the script JS file was caused by missing semicolons which was rectified by adding the missing semicolons. The other warnings were flaged up because the New JavaScript features (ES6) was not configured. After being configured those warnings were rectified.
