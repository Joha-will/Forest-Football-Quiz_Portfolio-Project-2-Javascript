# **Forest Football Quiz** 


## **Introduction**
Welcome to my second project, a general knowledge quiz app on Nottingham Forest Football club. 

The idea of my second project came from my love and interest in football in particular, my love for Nottingham Forest Football club and their promotion to the Premier league this year 2022. 

During the creation of my second project I have been able to develop my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. These skills have enabled me to create a more interactive and fun experience for the users. 

I aim to continuously develop and improve my skills I have learnt throughout my second project. 

In this README I will explain step by step the processes taken to create and plan this project including screen shots, images, links and more. 

Thank you for taking interest and viewing my project.

I hope you enjoy the quiz!

## **User Experience (UX)**


### **Creator Stories**

- ### Creator Goals
    - As a creator, I want the project to be accessible, fun and easy to play. 

    - As a creator, I want to create a football quiz as a celebration to their promotion to the Premier League. 

    - As a creator, I want to create a visually impressive quiz maintaining a football theme throughout. 

    Once creator goals have been set on what I want to accomplish with the quiz I set out to obtain relevant information through researching the football club history and achievements. 



### **User Stories**

- ### First time visitors goals
    - When visiting the quiz as a first time visitor, I want to see relevant pictures and themes that relate to the quiz topic, Nottingham Forest and football. So I have implemented a photo of the current football team as the background and football icons. I also want to have a clear understanding of how to play the quiz. I have implemented an about the quiz button, which gives instruction on how to play the quiz.
    
    - As a first time visitor, I want to easily navigate around the quiz without any difficulty. 

    - As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily find information about the quiz through social media links. I have placed these links at the bottom left of the page so they are easily found.

- ### Returning visitors goals
    - As a returning visitor, I want to find out about updates relating to the quiz. This can be found through the social media links, which are also used a point of contact.

- ### Frequent user goals
    - As a returning visitor, I would like to see visual changes and updates to the quiz content. For example the background image to be updated to the current Nottingham Forest football team.


### **Design**

- ### Colour Scheme 
    - The two main colours used were red and white as those are the colours of Nottingham Forest football kit and emblem.

- ### Typography 
    - I originally tried to use the offical Nottingham Forest emblem font however, this did not work because I could not find the font on Google fonts. Therefore, I chose the most simular looking font.

- ### Imagery 
    - I implemented a background image of the current Nottingham Forest football team to the body of the quiz.

- ### Wireframes

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!
