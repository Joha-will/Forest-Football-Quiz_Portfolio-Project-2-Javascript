# **Forest Football Quiz** 


## **Introduction**
Welcome to my second project, a general knowledge quiz app on Nottingham Forest Football club. 

The idea of my second project came from my love and interest in football in particular, my love for Nottingham Forest Football club and their promotion to the Premier league this year 2022. 

During the creation of my second project I have been able to develop my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. These skills have enabled me to create a more interactive and fun experience for the users. 

I aim to continuously develop and improve my skills I have learnt throughout my second project. 

In this README I will explain step by step the processes taken to create and plan this project including screen shots, images, links and more. 

Thank you for taking interest and viewing my project.

I hope you enjoy the quiz!

I used Chrome developer tools to test the responsiveness of the quiz as well as testing it on different web browsers like Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari and Opera.
The quiz was viewed a several different devices such as:

- Desktop
- Laptop
- Iphone SE
- Iphone XR
- Iphone 12 Pro
- Pixel 5
- Samsung Galaxy 8+
- Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
- Ipad Air
- Ipad Mini 
- Surface Pro 7
- Surface Duo 
- Galaxy Fold
- Samsung Galaxy A51/71
- Nest Hub
- Nest Hub Max
- Iphone 6/7/8
- Iphone 6/7/8 Plus
- Iphone X

**Lighthouse report**

I used the Google Lighthouse to check my project's performance, accessibility and user experience. The initial check results came back at 91 for overall performance which can be viewed by clicking the link below.
- [Lighthouse initial results](https://github.com/Joha-will/Portfolio-Project-2---Javascript-Essentials/blob/ccfb78205ae830d9e10caa1e59db4d5e989dd332/assets/images/lighthouseresults.png)

I then improved the performance by removing the link to the background image I had in the style.css file and used my own photo which was looked in the images folder. This increased the performance alot. I also added meta tags with a name and content attribute to the head element of the index.html file which took the Search Engine Optimization to 100. After making those changes, this then took the overall performance to 97 for desktop and 94 for mobile which can be viewed by clicking the links below.
- [Lighthouse Desktop results](https://github.com/Joha-will/Portfolio-Project-2---Javascript-Essentials/blob/8d706ac4c3a243494677f100736d6ae3876f2da7/assets/images/lighthouseresultpc.png)
- [Lighthouse Mobile results](https://github.com/Joha-will/Portfolio-Project-2---Javascript-Essentials/blob/8d706ac4c3a243494677f100736d6ae3876f2da7/assets/images/lighthouseresultsmobile.png)



### **Bugs and Errors found**



**HTML Errors and Warnings**

- [HTML error and warning screenShot](https://github.com/Joha-will/Portfolio-Project-2---Javascript-Essentials/blob/c3f62c760e3fa0cf2647017f8528ffb72b02b1f1/assets/images/htmlerrors.png)

The errors and warnings I encountered when validating my HTML page was rectified. The first warning I had was rectified by changing the section element to a div element as adviced by the W3C MarkUp Validator. I encountered this warning as my section element did not have a heading.

I also encountered two errors which came from the unordered list element in my footer element. I rectified this by completely removing the unordered list element and adding a div element with three paragraph elements. I then placed the anchor tags inside the paragraph elements. I encountered these errors because text was not allowed in unordered list element in the context I had it, as stated by the W3C MarkUp validator.

### **JS Hint Errors and Problems**

- [Quiz JS errors and problems screenshot](https://github.com/Joha-will/Portfolio-Project-2---Javascript-Essentials/blob/c3f62c760e3fa0cf2647017f8528ffb72b02b1f1/assets/images/jshinterrorstwo.png)

As shown in the screenshot above, most of the warnings that came for the quiz JS file was caused by missing semicolons and there was a unecessary semicolon, which was easily rectified by removing and adding semicolons. There were others like the warning on ling 109 where there was no zero infront of the decimal point and this was rectified by adding a zero. On line 151-152, there was an undefined variable as shown in the screenshot, which I rectified by declaring the variable globally. I also had an unused variable and a unused function. I removed the unused varible as it was not needed and the function I called at the end of the quiz JS file.

- [Script JS errors and problems screenshot](https://github.com/Joha-will/Portfolio-Project-2---Javascript-Essentials/blob/c3f62c760e3fa0cf2647017f8528ffb72b02b1f1/assets/images/jshinterrors.png)

As shown in the screenshot above, most of the warnings that came for the script JS file was caused by missing semicolons which was rectified by adding the missing semicolons. The other warnings were flaged up because the New JavaScript features (ES6) was not configured. After being configured those warnings were rectified.

## **Deployment**


 ### GitHub Pages

 The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps,

1. Log in to GitHub and local the GitHub repository.
2. At the top of repository (top of the page), locate the "settings" button in the horizontal menu.
3. On the left side of the page in the vertical menu, locate "Pages" button.
4. Under "source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "main", then click the "save" button.
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. After the page refreshes, a link to your published site should be above "source" in a green box.


#### **Forking the GitHub Repository**
By forking a GitHub repository you can make a copy of the original repository to your own GitHub account to view and make changes without making any changes to the original repository.

1. Log in to GitHub and local the GitHub repository.
2. At the top right of the page, locate "fork button" which is just below the bell icon.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
